## Pull Requests Guide

### Code Style Guide

The [ACE3 Code Style Guide](https://ace3mod.com/wiki/development/coding-guidelines.html#5-code-style) should be followed when making a contribution.

### Names:
English names for roles will be preferred, with the exception of German units.

All names will use modern English alphabet characters with no accents.

Characters like Ã¼ do not display properly in the asset browser.

### Inheritance:
Inheritance for units and vehicles shall be from an IFA3 class whenever possible.
If the faction cannot reasonably inherit from an IFA3 class, then classes from other mods may be used.

For example new US classes must inherit from an IFA3 class, while new Japanese classes may inherit from FOW as IFA3 has no Japanese content.

Once a 2PzD faction has established classes then future classes will inherit from them.

For example a Wehrmacht rifleman from 1939 will inherit from an IFA3 class
`class 2PzD_G_39_Rifle : LIB_GER_Soldier_base {};`

But a rifleman from later in the war will inherit from the new class
`class 2PzD_G_40_Jan_Rifle : 2PzD_G_39_Rifle {};`

### File Structure:
Base classes shall go in config.cpp so all other files may use them as needed.

New classes shall go in their own .hpp file and that file will be included in the config.cpp file.

For example, German Wehrmacht units for 1939 January will go in their own .hpp which will be in the config.cpp like this:
```
class cfgVehicles {

    class LIB_GER_Soldier_base;

    #include "units\german\G_1939_Jan.hpp"

}; //End cfgVehicles
```
